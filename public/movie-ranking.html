<h1>The Best Movie According to Anshul</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my most favourite movie and the reason being this as favourite because its direction is awesome and when I saw this movie for the first time I was totally in awe. I was like how on this earth a man can make this movie this great which has the combo of beautiful scenes, great story, and great casting</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>great sci-fi movie with brain bending story</p>
<h3>Martian</h3>
<p>I can never forget this movie. This movie gives the glimpse of how it would be stay alone in the mars if we have less resources. And how can we manage if we really need to stay for particular amount of time.</p>
